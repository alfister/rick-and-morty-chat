# Overview

Took this opportunity to learn Flutter and work with Flask for the first time.

I hope you enjoy!

# Development Stack
- Frontend: Flutter/Dart
- Backend: Python with Flask
- Database: MongoDB
- Protocol: RESTful API

# Setup

To run the backend,
1. `cd` into backend from the root directory
2. activate the `venv` (i.e. `source venv/bin/activate`)
3. run `python3 routes.py`

To run the frontend,
1. make sure you have Flutter downloaded
2. `cd` into frontend/my_app from the root directory
3. run `flutter run`

Note: This project was tested on MacOS.
